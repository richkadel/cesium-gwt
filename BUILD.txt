Notes on the build:

1. You may need to increase Maven's memory to compile.  I did this by
setting the environment variable:

export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m

2. To create the war file:

mvn install

Run this from cesium-gwt. This will install cesium-gwt-main jar in your maven repository,
which cesium-gwt-test war needs; and then it builds the cesium-gwt-test war in
target.

3. To run in DevMode (note this is much slower than running in SuperDevMode or
production mode...I use SuperDevMode exclusively now, for many reasons):

cd cesium-gwt-test
mvn gwt:run

Then you should be able to "Copy to Clipboard" (button) in the GWT Dev Mode window and
paste the URL in old versions of Firefox that still support DevMode, or into Chrome.
OpenGL must be enabled!

4. To run the app in "production mode" (WAY faster with GWT running natively),
I deploy to Tomcat.  Simply create a cesium-gwt.xml file in tomcat's 
"conf/Catalina/localhost" with the following content:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Context 
  docBase="[ !! your home directory and path to cesium-gwt here !! ]/cesium-gwt-test/target/cesium-gwt-test-0.1.1-SNAPSHOT.war"/>

NOTE!  There are some classes of bugs that could appear in production mode that don't show up in
dev mode, specifically, when using a JavaScript overlay object, accessing a
JsArray property, if that property is not actually in the underlying JavaScript object,
Dev Mode returns an empty JsArray, but Production Mode, it crashes with an exception.
This is one of the reasons I run in SuperDevMode now. I uncover these bugs immediately.

By default, GWT production mode exceptions are not very informative.  I couldn't
see where the bug was happening because of obfuscation.  You can change that with the
following settings that sacrifice some code size for readable stack traces
(file name and line number). Put this in all of your gwt.xml files. If you want to
optimize for *real* production later, you just comment this out and rebuild:

  <set-property name="compiler.stackMode" value="emulated" />
  <set-configuration-property name="compiler.emulatedStack.recordLineNumbers" value="true"/>
  <set-configuration-property name="compiler.emulatedStack.recordFileNames" value="true"/>

See, for example, cesium.gwt.xml.

5. For eclipse, there are several preliminary requirements.  

Upgrade to GWT Plugin 2.6(.x). I installed it through the Eclipse Marketplace, installing Google
Plugin for Eclipse 4.3. 

I also installed the GWT M2E Connector, which bundled m2e (which is needed).

IMPORTANT!  You also need Maven Integration for WTP!  Make sure you install it.  (There
is a version for Juno, and probably prior Eclipse versions, in the Marketplace.)

Finally, you should increase your memory configurations for Eclipse.  Find the
eclipse.ini file, and increase
or add -XXPermSize, -XXMaxPermSize, -Xms, -Xmx.  Here's the -vmargs section from my
eclipse.ini. Note the increased values:

-vmargs
-XX:PermSize=256m
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.6
-XstartOnFirstThread
-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts
-XX:MaxPermSize=512m
-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m
-Xdock:icon=../Resources/Eclipse.icns
-XstartOnFirstThread
-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts

6. Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects.  Browse to the "cesium-gwt" directory, and
select it.  By default, the "cesium-gwt" pom.xml and all of its sub-projects should be
checked, but you may need to enable an option to show sub-projects, and they should
all be selected. Optionally, you can select or create a Working Set to attach these
projects to, but you can also wait until after importing the project to do this, once
you get a feel for the layout.  I PREFER adding them to a Working Set because they
all come up as separate projects, including the top-level project "cesium-gwt".

7. Open the Project Properties for "cesium-gwt-test" and select "Project 
Facets", then click "Convert to faceted form..." This then allows you to add the Facet
for "Dynamic Web Module".  
  
NOTE: Maven Integration for WTP may restrict the version
of "Dynamic Web Module" to 2.5, and if you don't have the Maven WTP plugin installed
you will get screwed up later. Don't select 3.0 unless you are sure you have
Maven Integration for WTP installed and it accepts this later version of
"Dynamic Web Module".

Check "Dynamic Web Module" and select "Apply". This may start a project validation.
You can wait for it to complete if necessary, but you may also be able to continue.
(The percent complete for validation shows at the bottom of the main Eclipse window.)
Eclipse might also crash during the validation (often due to insufficient heap space).
Restart if required. If you increased Eclipse memory settings as described above,
hopefully this command will complete cleanly and quickly.

I also sometimes prefer disabling some of the validations. In Project
Properties, under "Validation", you can enable project specific settings and turn
off validation for HTML or XML, if it is getting stuck on one of those; or you can
disable validation all together.

11. Also in the Project Properties, select and open the Google section and select
"Web Toolkit". Check "Use Google Web Toolkit", and ensure GWT 2.6.0 or 2.6.1 (or later)
is selected.
The "Entry Point" module should be "cesiumsamples - com.harmonia". At this point, I
also selected "Configure SDKs" and changed the default GWT to 2.6.0, then ensured
this project was configured to use that version. The cesiumsamples Entry Point 
was automatically selected.

12. Also under the Google section, select "Web Application" and check "This project has
a WAR directory. Set the WAR directory to "src/main/webapp".

13. Under Project Properties, go to the Java Build Path, and select "Source" at the 
top. It should already be set correctly, but ensure the "Default output folder" is:

cesium-gwt/target/cesium-gwt-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/WEB-INF/classes

Click the OK button to close Project Properties and accept the settings thus far.
We are not finished, but Eclipse needs to reconfigure a few other settings before
we can make the final tweaks.

At this point, I had problems and Eclipse wouldn't let me click OK, so I clicked cancel,
then re-opened the Project Properties, and re-set the Google settings again.

14. Under Project Properties, go to "Deployment Assembly", a new section that appears
only after adding the "Dynamic Web Module" facet in the earlier step. 

Remove the "/WebContent" entry.

Add the following:

Folder: "src/test/webapp" (this should automatically indicate "Deploy Path" is "/")
Java Build Path Entry: "Maven Dependencies"

[WARNING: If Eclipse is not accepting the "Maven Dependencies" it's probably because 
you don't have the eclipse plugin "Maven Integration for WTP".  Install it from 
the marketplace for your Eclipse version. If you get an error saying you have
a Facet for Dynamic Web Module set to the wrong version (e.g., if you had it
set to 3.0 and Eclipse Integration for WTP requires 2.5), you will have to delete
and re-create your project.  Sorry, but this shouldn't happen if you installed
Eclipse Integration for WTP from the beginning.]

Click "Apply".

You may wish to restart Eclipse.

I restarted. Then I noticed some syntax errors because the project had reset to Java 1.6
and I was using some 1.7 syntactic sugar. The "Quick Fix" option automatically reset
my project to 1.7 and the syntax errors disappeared. But I am trying to maintain 1.6
compatibility, so, please remove 1.7 features.

15. Set up the Run Configuration for the GWT app (this works for DevMode and also as
an excellent, simple built-in HTTP server to use when running in SuperDev mode:

Type is Web Application (Google "G" icon)

Name: "Cesium-GWT" or whatever

Project: cesium-gwt

Main class: com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode

Under "Server", port 8888

Under "GWT", port 9997.  The module should already be highlighted: cesiumsamples

Under "Arguments", enter the following runtime arguments:

    [NOTE: The <path-to-your-project> needs to be updated to your project parent dir]

-remoteUI "${gwt_remote_ui_server_port}:${unique_id}" -logLevel INFO -port 8888 
-startupUrl cesium-gwt.html 
-war /<path-to-your-project>/cesium-gwt/cesium-gwt-test/target/cesium-gwt-test-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT 
-codeServerPort 9997 com.harmonia.cesiumsamples

and for VM arguments:

-Xms1024M -Xmx2048M -XX:PermSize=256M -XX:MaxPermSize=512M 

16. For SuperDevMode:

Create a Run Configuration of type Java Application. Name it 

"Cesium-GWT SuperDevMode" 

or something like that. Set the project to cesium-gwt.

Set the main class to:

com.google.gwt.dev.codeserver.CodeServer

Set program arguments to:

-src /Users/richkadel/work/harmonia/sapphire/cesium-gwt/cesium-gwt-test/src/main/java com.harmonia.cesiumsamples

and for VM arguments:

-Xms1024M -Xmx2048M -XX:PermSize=256M -XX:MaxPermSize=512M 

And you PROBABLY need to add the following classpath User Entries:

"Advanced" entry -> Folder -> cesium-gwt-test/src/test/jar
"Project" -> cesium-gwt-main
gwt-user-2.6.x.jar
gwt-dev-2.6.x.jar

You SHOULD already see the gwt-dev jar in User Entries. If not, you will need to add it.
I added both of the GWT jars from my .m2/repositories directory under my home directory.
