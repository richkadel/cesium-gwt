cesium-gwt
==========

GWT wrappers around some of the Cesium JS library.

The latest version has been upgraded to Cesium 1.2 and was also tested
against Cesium 1.0. This release should still be forward-compatible with
future Cesium JavaScript releases, but some new features (such as
GeoJSON support) may not be backward compatible. (For example, GeoJSON
support was added to Cesium after 1.0's release. Cesium-GWT now supports
GeoJSON, but only if you are using a version of Cesium that support it.)
